### Definitions
A company is any buisness whose stock is listed on a U.S. stock exchange or whose securities are publicly offered in the United States.


Business outlook is a qualitative measure of how a company believes it will preform financially, espically in the short-term. For example, if a company believes its new product will have a record number of sales, that it a positive business outlook. If a company thinks that it will expierince supply-chain issues, thus taking loss in the near future, that is a negative business outlook. The term outlook is also used.


### Define the Problem
Predict the future stock prices of a variety of companies. Develop a model of the stock market that uses high-quality sources; the model should be accurate.
### Assumptions
1. If a company has a generally positive and/or optimistic about its business (positive outlook), the price of the stock will increase. If a company is generally negative and/or pessimistic about its business (negative outlook), the price of the stock will decrease.
*Justification: a company that thinks it will do well in the future act more confident in front of investors. As a result, investors will drive the price of the stock up. A company that does not think it will do well will act less confident, making investors nervous or skeptical. This could drive the stock price down.*  
2. All company will describe their outlook truthfully in a legal filing with the SEC, such as a 10-k report.
 *Justification: a company that lies about their financial or economic situation in a report to the SEC might face severe legal consequences. Most companies would not take that risk. So, they would provide the truth about their business outlook.*  
3. All companies will describe their outlook truthfully in a earnings call.
*Justification: if a company lies to their investors or romanticizes their situation, and then do not preform as expected, investors would lose trust in the company. This could cause social and economic consequences for the company and would possibly incur a loss greater than simply admitting to the true expected earnings. Most companies would take the lesser risk and answer questions on earnings calls with the truth.*
