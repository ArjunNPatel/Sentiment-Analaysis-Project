"""
Splits the text from section 1A and 7 of a 10k filing CSV into setencnes. Analyzes each sentence with sentiment analysis. 
Takes the average of the scores and magnitudes.
One drawback of this is the values generated from each sentences contributes equally to each sentence. 
(In the weighted average calculation, all sentences recieve the weight of 1). 
For example:
A company writes "Frustration with customer support remains a *very minor* cause of social tensions".
The next sentence is "*Very minor* growth in earnings expected from new product".
The second sentence should be weighted higher because earnings tracks stock value very closely, while social tensions does not necessarily do so.
